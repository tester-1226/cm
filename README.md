Project purpose:
The purpose of our project is to encourage people to get more involved in their community and collaborate with one another, forming strong bonds within the community and possibly beyond.

Tools utilized:
The tools we used for our project were HTML, CSS, React/JavaScript, and Google Firebase.

Problems the team ran into and how we overcame them:
The largest challenge faced was the lack of time. We were able to plan out and start developing a lot of great and useful features but many of them did not make it to the final product. Operating under a time crunch was difficult and the process of accessing and removing features was a grating one. Then of course there were technical difficulties that we ran into, which took up even more time to debug as certain lines of code would not want to cooperate. Aside from that we also would face certain bottlenecks where the frontend developers had to wait for the backend developers and vice versa before they could continue coding.

Despite these challenges, the journey of building Community Heroes has been immensely rewarding, fueled by the belief in the transformative power of community collaboration and volunteerism. Even though we did not finish, our mission remains steadfast: to empower individuals to become active participants in shaping vibrant and resilient communities.

Public Frameworks:
We used Google Firebase and GitHub for our public frameworks.
