Project purpose:
The purpose of our project is to encourage people to get more involved in their community and collaborate with one another, forming strong bonds within the community and possibly beyond.

Tools utilized:
The tools we used for our project were HTML, CSS, React/JavaScript, and Google Firebase.

Problems the team ran into and how we overcame them:
The largest challenge faced was the lack of time. We were able to plan out and start developing a lot of great and useful features but many of them did not make it to the final product. Operating under a time crunch was difficult and the process of accessing and removing features was a grating one. Then of course there were technical difficulties that we ran into, which took up even more time to debug as certain lines of code would not want to cooperate. Aside from that we also would face certain bottlenecks where the frontend developers had to wait for the backend developers and vice versa before they could continue coding.

Despite these challenges, the journey of building Community Heroes has been immensely rewarding, fueled by the belief in the transformative power of community collaboration and volunteerism. Even though we did not finish, our mission remains steadfast: to empower individuals to become active participants in shaping vibrant and resilient communities.

Public Frameworks:
We used Google Firebase and GitHub for our public frameworks.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
